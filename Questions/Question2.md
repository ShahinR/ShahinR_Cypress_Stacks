## Question 2

Now it's time to see your technical skills

Given the skeleton provided, we would like you to automate the following 2 Test Case

1. **User signs up in the platform**
2. **User perform an order of 2 items**

The API for the provided website (http://www.demoblaze.com") are open, so we would like you to use this API to speed up some parts of this E2E Exercise. So we expect some actions to be performed in the Front and some others in the Backend.

Good Luck
