## Question 1

*NOTE: This test itâ€™s about your experience, so we encourage you to use it in this test.*

This exercise consists in suggesting a plan to deal with a (not real, but plausible) challenging situation in a startup environment. Do not hesitate to add any assumption you need, just justify it.

**Big Picture Context**
 - You work as a QA Engineer for ManoMano company.
 - You serve different features teams (aka squads) and help them in testing activities. The development teams you serve work an iteratively and incrementally way.
 - They are used to deliver new software releases every two weeks.

**Specific Context**
 - The squad is composed of five developers, one SRE, one IT Lead, one Product Manager and you. 
 - The team feels safe because you find a lot of bugs and you are a defensive line before going to production.

**Other relevant information:**
 - The QA manager, aligned with the CTO and the CPO, wants to change the way the company provides value to the customer. To do that, they agree on the need to deliver new software releases on a daily basis (web frontend and backend).
 - They expect to accomplish the daily basis releases in no longer than 3 months, to keep the business ahead of the competitors.
 - As you are an experienced QA, the QA manager asks you for a plan to achieve the expected output.

**CHALLENGE: Assuming this challenging situation, could you provide us with the 2 - 3 main points you would choose to start implementing the QA plan to accomplish the expected output? Describing why selecting them in the simplest (2 lines maximum per  point) way.**

*We will evaluate having in mind the requirement of 1hour for the two exercices:*
 * How you move forward the plan and how you define the first priority steps of it.
 * How you justify the selection of the above 2 or 3 mentioned points
